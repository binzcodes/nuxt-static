# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `components/placeholder` directory is an example of a domain-specific Component store.

Components that are reusable in different pages but belong within a specific domain,
in this case the "landing page" domain
These place them in separate folders under components, one folder per domain

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
