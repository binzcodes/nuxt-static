# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `components/ui` directory contains your UI Components: those that are reusable across the whole app. 

They should communicate just by using props and events, not holding any application logic.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
