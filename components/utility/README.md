# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `components/utility` directory contains utility Components:
those that are reusable across the whole app but belong to no domain and not ui or layout based.

They may have some logic but delegate the rendering to children 

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
